# 🍽️ EatWise – Food Nutrition Tracker

**EatWise** is a simple yet powerful web application that helps users make informed dietary decisions based on their personal health goals. Users can search for any food item and get nutritional information such as calories, proteins, carbs, and fats. The app recommends whether a food item aligns with a selected goal: **Balanced Diet**, **Weight Loss**, or **Muscle Gain**.
